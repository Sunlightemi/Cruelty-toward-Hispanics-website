                <p>There are many families that because of racism they are getting a low pay which can result in dept and/or less food provided for their family. They need the money to survive and to take care of their families. There is an organization called the ACLU that takes all kinds of peoples cases to court and sometimes specifically to those ethnic groups dealing with racism and they are always happy take money donations to be able to take those cases to court. You can help them out and donate money.</p>
